min_viz
=======

Testing stuff in for `nengo_viz` without running Nengo models.

Use Python Tornado because I don't know how to refresh my page every time I make a change in the code.

Run the code by running `python main.py`. All the javascript code is in
`static/js/min_main.js` and the JavaScript gets called from `templates/index.html`.
